# React Native Jobs
The goal of this project is to build an app that will utilize:
 - Facebook login
 - Map Functionality
 - Push Notifications
 - App Loading Screen
 - Tinder styled Swipe Deck
 - Realtime job data using an API (UPDATE) Indeed Jobs API stopped giving developers API keys to test with, so I had to make a fake_data.json to simulate the same API response and to keep testing app features
 - Multiple component and screen navigation
